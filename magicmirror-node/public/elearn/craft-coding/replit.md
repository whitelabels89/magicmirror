# Craft & Coding Complete Course: Interactive Learning Modules L1-L5

## Overview

This is a complete interactive educational web application series designed for children to learn craft-making and basic coding concepts. The course consists of 5 progressive lessons (L1-L5), each built as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, creating an engaging online learning experience without requiring any external frameworks or backend infrastructure.

3. **Quiz Interaction**: Store answers immediately upon selection
4. **Template Selection**: Save chosen template and enable download
5. **File Upload**: Process and store image references locally
6. **Progress Calculation**: Real-time updates based on completed activities
7. **Session Summary**: Display comprehensive results on final slide

## External Dependencies

### CDN-Based Libraries
- **FilePond**: Image upload and preview functionality
  - Core library: `filepond.css` and `filepond.js`
  - Image preview plugin: `filepond-plugin-image-preview.css`
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements
- **Google Fonts**: Fredoka One and Nunito font families

### Design Assets
- Template images (car, robot, airplane) embedded as data URIs or external links
- Animated step-by-step instruction graphics
- Progress indicators and UI icons

## Deployment Strategy

### Multi-File Course Structure
- **Landing Page**: `index.html` - Welcome page with course overview
- **Lesson Files**: Individual HTML files for each lesson (L1-L5)
- **Rationale**: Easy navigation between lessons while maintaining single-file simplicity
- **Entry Point**: Root URL `/` loads the welcome page automatically

### Platform Compatibility
- **LMS Integration**: Compatible with most learning management systems
- **Hosting**: Can be served from any static web server
- **Offline Capability**: Functions without internet after initial load (except CDN dependencies)

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and templates loaded on-demand
- **Caching**: Browser caching for static assets
- **Minification**: CSS and JavaScript can be minified for production
