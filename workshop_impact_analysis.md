# Impact Analysis: "Petualangan Kody di Dunia Digital"

The provided script outlines a multi-level workshop in which children help a character named Kody explore five themed digital worlds. Each world introduces a new concept—from basic digital literacy to robotics—using simple interactive activities.

## Educational Impact
- **Digital Literacy**: The opening level familiarizes participants with common hardware and software, encouraging recognition of everyday technology. This helps build a basic foundation of tech awareness.
- **Programming Introduction**: Subsequent levels introduce Python, web development, mobile apps, and robotics. These progressive steps expose children to real coding concepts (e.g., `print("Halo Dunia")`) and simple logic sequences.
- **Hands-on Engagement**: Activities like drag‑and‑drop games, typing exercises, and robot navigation allow children to actively participate rather than passively observe, supporting better retention and excitement.

## Motivational Aspects
- **Gamified Progression**: The badge system (e.g., "Penyihir Kode Pertama," "Master Robotron") and narrative structure transform learning into an adventure, motivating students to continue through each stage.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Demonstrating the result of a code snippet or pressing a digital button provides instant gratification, helping young learners understand cause and effect.

## Broader Benefits
- **Early Exposure to Technology**: By covering various digital domains, the workshop may spark interest in fields such as programming and robotics at a young age.
- **Collaboration and Teamwork**: Some levels encourage working together (e.g., testing alarms simultaneously), fostering communication skills alongside technical ability.

Overall, the text promotes an accessible approach to digital literacy, combining storytelling with practical tasks to keep children engaged while introducing fundamental tech concepts.
